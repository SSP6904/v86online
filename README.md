# v86online
Play x86 based operating systems in your browser!

## How it works
It's simple. This application uses the v86 API, which then interacts with a disk image to run the VM in, while the WASM framework is running the app in the background. This is all plain Javascript, and the other side is webassembly. You can choose on what system you can try out and use.
